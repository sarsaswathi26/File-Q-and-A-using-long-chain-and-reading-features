# File-Q-and-A-using-long-chain-and-reading-features
This project is a File Question-Answering System built using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain. It allows users to upload a file (PDF, text, document, etc.) and ask questions about its content. The system reads the file, processes the text, and generates accurate answers based on the file’s information.
